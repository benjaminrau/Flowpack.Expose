Flowpack Expose Documentation
=============================

What is Expose ?
----------------

Expose provides various components to quickly build tables, forms and whole cruds
for Doctrine Entities. The general aim and focus is to reduce the boilerplate code you
currently have to write for things like forms, lists, etc. to as little as possible
while still retaining as much flexibility as possible.
